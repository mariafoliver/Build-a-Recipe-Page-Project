      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is the best fudge recipe ever! It's my aunt's recipe, passed down through the family.</p>
      <p> It's better than any fudge I've ever had at the Jersey shore and easy enough to whip up in 15 minutes or so</p>

        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups milk chocolate chips</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil; set aside.</li>

        <li>Remove from heat and add milk chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate chips; stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Stir in nuts and vanilla. Pour into prepared pan; chill in refrigerator for 2 hours, or until firm.</li>
